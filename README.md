# Contextual-Sarcasm_Detection

## What this project is about 
Sarcasm is tough to understand, so much more when the person in front is good with his/her words. Some sentences and even words spoken in certain contexts are sarcastic while they read as perfectly fine as a standalone.  This project aims to enhance sarcasm detection by hybridizing the three best-performing models in past research work: CNN, LSTM, and Random Forest along with performing dynamic Learning Rate Schedule Optimization in order to cancel out noise in the data and help the deep learning models learn more effectively.
